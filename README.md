## Description

The Tsai CLI is extends from nestjs cli.
It is a command-line interface tool that helps you to initialize, develop, and maintain your Nestjs monorepo workspace.

It embodies best-practice architectural patterns to encourage well-structured apps.

The CLI works with [schematics](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/tree/master/packages/angular_devkit/schematics), and provides built in support from the schematics collection at [@tsailab/schematics](https://github.com/lotolab/tsai-schematics).
